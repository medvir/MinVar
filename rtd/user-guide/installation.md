## Installation

The easiest way to install MinVar is via bioconda. Click on the image above
and follow the instructions there.

Here below we explain how to install with [ansible](http://www.ansible.com).

### Setting up with Ansible

The directory [`ansible`](https://github.com/ozagordi/MinVar/tree/master/ansible)
in the project repo provides an easy option to set up MinVar with
its dependencies on a dedicated machine. The files therein define an
[ansible](http://www.ansible.com/) play for this purpose.

#### What is Ansible

Ansible is a deployment tool that allows an automatic provisioning of machines
on the cloud (it can be used on AWS, DigitalOcean, Google Cloud Platform etc.).
The user installs it on a local machine (this can be your old laptop), defines
commands in specific files and uses them to set up a remote machine.

In the following we will assume that you have installed ansible on your local
laptop and you want to set up MinVar on a remote machine running Linux Ubuntu 16.04.
The access to this machine is provided by private-public SSH key pair that must be
set up. Good instructions for this task can be found in this
[help](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys).

#### How to proceed

1. Install ansible on your machine (on Mac OS X you can do it via the package
   manager [brew](https://brew.sh) with `brew install ansible`),
2. clone MinVar from GitHub with `git clone https://github.com/ozagordi/MinVar.git`
   or download/unzip it,
3. move to the directory `ansible` in the cloned repository and identify the file
   `hosts`. This file contains two lines `[minvarmachine]` and a fake ip address.
   Edit the address to the one of the machine you want to setup,
4. in the same directory edit the file `setup-hosts.sh`: adapt
   `--key-file=path_to_your_private_key` to point to your personal **private** key,
5. copy your personal **public** key into `my.key.pub`,
6. run `./setup-hosts.sh`.

#### What can go wrong

We assumed that you have an Ubuntu 16.04 available. Most of the stuff will work
on Ubuntu 14.04, but you might run into troubles because of different versions
of Java (you can find a good tutorial on this
[here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-java-with-apt-get-on-ubuntu-16-04)).

`UNREACHABLE!` usually means that the private/public key pair does not work.
You must be able to ssh into the remote machine with this command (edit accordingly)

    ssh -i path_to_your_private_key ubuntu@remote_ip_address

### If you don't want to use ansible

The ansible [playbook](https://github.com/ozagordi/MinVar/blob/master/ansible/setup.yml)
reads almost as plain English. You can manually copy the instructions from there
and install what you need.

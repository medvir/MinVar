It reduces susceptibility to NVP, ETR, RPV, and EFV by >50-fold, 5-fold, 3-fold, and 2-fold, respectively. Although Y181C itself reduces EFV susceptibility by only 2-fold, it is associated with a reduced response to an EFV-containing regimen because viruses with this mutation often harbor additional minority variant NNRTI-resistance mutations. Y181C has a weight of 2.5 in the Tibotec ETR GSS.
